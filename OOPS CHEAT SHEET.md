### OOP Master Cheat Sheet for Interview Preparation (with Real-World Examples)

This cheat sheet is an enhanced version of the previous one with real-world examples to help you better understand and remember key OOP concepts and Java topics. Each section is enriched with practical applications that you can relate to.

## 1. **Core OOP Concepts**:

### 1.1 **Encapsulation**:
Encapsulation is the bundling of data (variables) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It restricts direct access to some of an object’s components, which is essential for protecting the object’s state.

**Real-World Example**:  
Imagine a **bank account** class. The balance field should not be directly accessible by external code (like a hacker). Encapsulation helps in hiding the account balance, and only authorized methods (like `withdraw` and `deposit`) are allowed to change the balance.
```java
public class BankAccount {
    private double balance;
    public double getBalance() { return balance; }
    public void deposit(double amount) { balance += amount; }
    public void withdraw(double amount) { balance -= amount; }
}
```

### 1.2 **Abstraction**:
Abstraction involves hiding the internal implementation details and showing only essential information. This makes complex systems easier to manage and understand.

**Real-World Example**:  
Think of a **coffee machine**. You don’t need to know how it works internally to use it. You just press a button to get a coffee. Similarly, in OOP, an abstract class provides the necessary functionality, and the internal complexities are hidden.
```java
abstract class CoffeeMachine {
    abstract void brewCoffee();
}
```

### 1.3 **Inheritance**:
Inheritance allows a class to inherit the properties and behavior (methods) of another class. It supports code reusability and hierarchical classification.

**Real-World Example**:  
In a **vehicle hierarchy**, we have a base class `Vehicle`, and subclasses like `Car` and `Bike`. Both `Car` and `Bike` inherit properties from `Vehicle` such as speed, but they might implement their own specific behaviors.
```java
class Vehicle {
    int speed;
    void drive() { System.out.println("Driving"); }
}
class Car extends Vehicle {
    void drive() { System.out.println("Car driving"); }
}
class Bike extends Vehicle {
    void drive() { System.out.println("Bike driving"); }
}
```

### 1.4 **Polymorphism**:
Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class. There are two types:
- **Compile-time polymorphism (method overloading)**.
- **Runtime polymorphism (method overriding)**.

**Real-World Example**:  
In a **payment system**, different payment methods like `CreditCard`, `PayPal`, and `UPI` can implement a `pay()` method in their own way. At runtime, the payment type determines which method is invoked, but the user just calls `payment.pay()`.
```java
class Payment {
    void pay() { System.out.println("Processing payment"); }
}
class CreditCard extends Payment {
    void pay() { System.out.println("Payment with CreditCard"); }
}
class PayPal extends Payment {
    void pay() { System.out.println("Payment with PayPal"); }
}
```

## 2. **Key OOP Supporting Concepts**:

### 2.1 **Constructor**:
Constructors initialize objects. They can be overloaded for different ways of initialization.

**Real-World Example**:  
Imagine a **user profile** in an app. You may create users with different details like name and email. A constructor will initialize user data upon object creation.
```java
public class User {
    private String name;
    private String email;
    public User(String name, String email) {
        this.name = name;
        this.email = email;
    }
}
```

### 2.2 **Getter and Setter Methods**:
Getters and setters control access to private fields, enforcing data validation if needed.

**Real-World Example**:  
In a **library system**, you may want to control how many books a user can borrow. A setter can prevent users from borrowing more than a certain number of books.
```java
public class LibraryUser {
    private int booksBorrowed;
    public void setBooksBorrowed(int books) {
        if (books <= 5) {  // Maximum limit
            this.booksBorrowed = books;
        }
    }
}
```

## 3. **SOLID Principles** (Object-Oriented Design Best Practices):

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**:  
   **Example**: A **printer class** should only handle printing tasks, not formatting documents. Formatting should be handled by another class.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**:  
   **Example**: In an **order processing system**, if you introduce new payment methods like `GooglePay`, you should be able to extend your existing payment class without modifying the old code.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**:  
   **Example**: A **rectangle class** and its subclass `Square` should be substitutable. However, if square alters the behavior of width and height in unexpected ways, it violates this principle.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**:  
   **Example**: A **printer interface** should separate actions like scanning, printing, and faxing into smaller interfaces so that clients can implement only the necessary ones.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**:  
   **Example**: A **high-level module** like `OrderService` should not depend directly on low-level modules like `PaymentGateway`. Instead, they should both depend on an abstraction (`PaymentProcessor` interface).

---

## 4. **Class vs Interface**:

- **Real-World Example**:
  - A **class** like `Human` may have attributes like name, age, and actions like eating or walking.
  - An **interface** like `Employee` can define actions like `getSalary()` or `work()`. Classes like `Manager` and `Developer` implement this interface.

---

## 5. **Java-Specific OOP Features**:

### 5.1 **Abstract Classes**:
**Real-World Example**:  
A **bank account** can be abstract, as specific account types like `SavingsAccount` and `CurrentAccount` will have their own implementations of methods such as `calculateInterest()`.
```java
abstract class BankAccount {
    abstract void calculateInterest();
}
```

### 5.2 **Final Keyword**:
- **Final Class**: Prevents extension (e.g., a **utility class** with static methods).
- **Final Method**: Stops subclasses from overriding critical functionality.

### 5.3 **Static Keyword**:
- **Real-World Example**:  
  A **utility class** with static methods, like `Math` in Java. The `Math.pow()` method can be called without creating a Math object.

---

## 6. **Design Patterns**:

- **Singleton Pattern**: Used when you need only one instance of a class, such as a **configuration manager** in an application.
- **Factory Pattern**: When creating **vehicles**, a factory can return an instance of `Car`, `Bike`, or `Truck` depending on input.
- **Observer Pattern**: Used in **notification systems**, where different subscribers (email, SMS) get notified when an event occurs.
- **Decorator Pattern**: Adding functionality to a base **coffee** class without modifying it. You can add `Milk` or `Sugar` as decorators.

---

## 7. **Exception Handling**:

**Real-World Example**:  
In a **file reader application**, you must handle exceptions like `FileNotFoundException` or `IOException` when trying to read files.
```java
try {
    File file = new File("data.txt");
    FileReader fr = new FileReader(file);
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

---

## 8. **Enumerations**:

- **Real-World Example**:  
  An enum can represent **days of the week**.
  ```java
  enum Day {
      MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY;
  }
  ```

---

## 9. **Common Java Concepts**:

### 9.1 **Object Cloning**:
- **Real-World Example**:  
  When you need a copy of a **document** without affecting the original, cloning creates a separate copy of that document object.

### 9.2 **this vs super**:
- **Real-World Example**:  
  A **car class** that uses `this` to refer to the current car object and `super` to call methods from its parent `Vehicle` class.

---

## 10. **Java Memory Management**:
- **Real-World Example**:  
  When multiple users are booking seats for a concert, **heap memory** stores user objects (instances), while local method variables are stored in the **stack memory**.

---

## 11. **Miscellaneous Key Topics**:

- **Dynamic Method Dispatch**:  
  **Example**: In a **music player**, you may select different music players (`MP3Player`, `AACPlayer`), but at runtime, the appropriate `play()` method is executed based on the object type.

- **Method Overriding Rules**:  
  Ensures consistency across inherited classes while allowing specialization.

---

### Final Tips:

- **Practice Coding**: Make sure to write code for these concepts to solidify your understanding.
- **Real-World Analogies**: Link concepts to everyday

 objects or systems for better recall during interviews.
